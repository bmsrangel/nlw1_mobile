# Ecoleta Mobile

Flutter application developed with the Rocketseat's Next Level Week #1, which was originally developed using React Native.
The master branch is trying to follow the closest as possible the original application in RN. However, there's a bracnh under development which will contain the same application developed more similar to a Flutter application.
